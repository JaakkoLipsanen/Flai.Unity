## Flai.Unity

Flai.Unity is a collection of helpful classes, scripts, tools, editor extensions that I created while developing Unity games.  
I don't particularily like the Unity API since I found it to be pretty poorly designed and not follow C# naming or coding conventions very often, so there are also some examples where I've just pretty much created a class that wraps some of the Unity's own classes (a good example of this is FlaiInput class, which provides much nicer API for input querying than the Unity's own Input class).
